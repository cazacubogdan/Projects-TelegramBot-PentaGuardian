This Python script is a Telegram bot that achieves the following use cases:

Reads the Telegram bot API key from a file stored in /app/Secrets/api_key_pentabot.txt
Kicks and bans bots.
Generates a random math challenge and sends it to new users who join the channel. Restricts new users to prevent them from sending or seeing any group messages before answering the math challenge.
Checks the language of messages sent in chat after the math challenge is complete and only allows messages in English.
Bans users who fail to answer the math challenge correctly, or send non-human responses.
Stores banned user IDs in a file for persistent storage across bot restarts.
Sets up logging to a file for debugging purposes and has the possibility to choose various logging levels.
Sends a private message to the user getting banned containing the reason for the ban and, at the same time, posts a message on the group saying which user has been banned and why.
The script achieves these functionalities through a series of functions that handle different aspects of the Telegram bot:

generate_math_challenge(): Generates a random math challenge question and its answer.
on_new_member(): Handles new members joining the chat, bans bots, sends math challenges to new users, and restricts their permissions.
on_message(): Handles messages from users, checking if the user has completed the math challenge and if their answer is correct. Bans users who fail the challenge or send non-human responses.
check_english(): Checks if the message sent by a user is in English; bans the user and deletes their message if not.
ban_user(): Bans a user, sends a private message to the user with the ban reason, and posts a message in the group chat stating who has been banned and why.
check_spam(): Checks if a user is spamming the chat based on message frequency and bans them if they are.
check_links(): Checks for links in a user's message and bans the user if any are found, also deleting the message with the link(s).
The main function initializes the bot, registers handlers for different events, and starts the bot. The bot uses the python-telegram-bot library for interacting with the Telegram API and the langdetect library for detecting the language of a message.
